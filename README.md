# ðŸ¤– GenAI on AWS â€” Starter

This project will grow into a **clean, real-world GenAI service** on AWS.

Weâ€™ll start **small**:
- A tiny serverless API (API Gateway â†’ Lambda) that runs and returns a simple JSON.
- Then, step by step, weâ€™ll add DynamoDB, Bedrock model calls, CI/CD, and observability.

**Goal:** learn by building, keep it simple, ship value early, and improve in small safe steps.

## Roadmap (short)
1. Minimal serverless API (today)
2. Add DynamoDB for chat history
3. Call Amazon Bedrock from Lambda
4. CI/CD with GitHub Actions (OIDC)
5. Observability and cost controls
